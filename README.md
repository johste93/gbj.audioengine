# Audio Engine for Unity

A simple audio engine intended to make audio engineers less reliant on a programmer to create, add and adjust music and sound effects. A.K.A Poor mans FMOD / Wwise.

## Features:

## Dependencies:
    Unity 2021
    Unity.Addressables

## Install via git URL

Requires a version of unity that supports path query parameter for git packages (Unity >= 2019.3.4f1, Unity >= 2020.1a21). You can add https://github.com/johste93/gbj.audioengine.git?path=Assets/GBJ.AudioEngine to Package Manager

or add "gbj.audioengine": "https://github.com/johste93/gbj.audioengine.git?path=Assets/GBJ.AudioEngine" to Packages/manifest.json.

If you want to set a target version, gbj.audioengine uses the *.*.* release tag so you can specify a version like #0.0.2. For example https://github.com/johste93/gbj.audioengine.git?path=Assets/GBJ.AudioEngine#0.0.2.
